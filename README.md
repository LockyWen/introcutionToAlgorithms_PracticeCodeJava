Chapter 1 and 2:

`Definitions`

An algorithm is any well-defined computational procedure that takes some value, or set of values, as input and procedures some value, or set of values, as output. 

An instance of a problem consists of the input (satisfying the representation invariant) needed to compute a solution to the problem. 

An algorithm is said to be correct if for every input instance, it halts with the correct output. 

Incorrect algorithms can sometimes be useful, if we can control their error rate. 

A subsequence of X is just X with some (or possibly all or none) of its elements removed. 

The convex hull is the smallest convex polygon containing the points

A data structure is a way to store and organize data in order to facilitate access and modification. 

Defferent algorithms devised to solve the same problem often differ dramatically in their efficiency. 

The numbers that we wish to sort are also known as the keys.
